# flagwarriors
A simple phaser.js game inspired by AoE2 and "Capture the Flag"

This was my first javascript project (2016) so yes it's total mess but I've been through a lot of tech issues.
I won't update it anymore but you can be inspired by it.

Demo [here](https://flagwarriors.herokuapp.com)

## package: 
* phaser
* easystar (path finding)
* multi player (2p)
* socket.io
* ...

## TODO : 
* Use Gulp instead of Webpack (don't realy need webpack)
* Functional programming approach (I didn't know it back then)
* Better assets
* ...

run game :

bower install
npm install
node app.js

Go to http://localhost:3000

Ready for Heroku
